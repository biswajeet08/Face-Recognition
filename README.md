# Face-Recognition
Face-Recognition is developed to identify the person coming infront of the camera and put the name of the person on his/her face if identified.
It works in 3 files.

1.main.py= this file is used to run to take 50 images of the person to train. This file on execition will ask for id and name of the person to store in dataset.json file.

2.training.py= Once taken the sample pictures, this file is used for training. Training the sample pictures to get a resultant image of the person.

3.recognize.py=finally you can run this file to identify the person infront of the camera and put a name accordingly. If not identified, it will put "Unknown".
